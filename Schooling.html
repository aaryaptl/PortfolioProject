        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Aarya Patel, I studied in St. Joseph's public school, King Koti branch, Hyderabad. I joined in SJPS in June,2008. I joined here in LKG(2008) and completed my 10th in February,2020. OMG! I was there for almost 12 years, i can't believe that i have spent a whole lot of 12 years at that place. School life is one of the most cherished phases of life. It is a journey filled with learning, friendship, fun, and valuable life lessons.</p>
    
    <h2>Early Years</h2>
    <p>My schooling began at a lively elementary school. I still remember the first day—nervous yet excited to step into a world of learning. I knew nothing except daily going to school and coming half-day crying in search on Mom. Initially, I used to think that they have left me alone here and went home. I had no choice other than making friends and enjoy the pripratory school. I never thought that, this is the plcae where i will making friends for life. Early years in school was truly Memorable. </p>
    
    <h2>Middle School Adventures</h2>
    <p>As I progressed into middle school, my interests expanded. <span class="highlight">Sports, computer labs, and friendship.</span> So, these were perticularly my area of interests. I would call myself lucky because, i made friends not only in my class, but rather in other sections as well. Our school total had 10 sections for each class. I knew almost everyone from each section. Each section had almost around 55-60 students. So, almost total strength of each class would be around 500 students. This was the place where we made friends not for a reason nor having to expect something in return. It was an  open  minded friendship not expecting something in return. But honestly, I must say, we all had great unity when it comes to bunking classes and playing outdoord, or cracking jokes. It was truly lots of fun:)</p>
    
    <h2>High School Challenges and Achievements</h2>    
    <p>High school was a mix of challenges and triumphs. From handling academic pressure to making lifelong friends, it shaped me into who I am today. Every school day followed a routine: Morning prayers, classes, lunch breaks, and games. Each moment contributed to unforgettable experiences. Bonding with friends is something that was very important and that i build over there. Our batch was lucky enough because, we comleted our 10th and immediately that was the time when the COVID-19 virus enters India and we have to face "The Lockdown". </p>
    
    <h2>Memorable Events</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Being a back bencher</li>
        <li>Participating in a school Annual cultural festival</li>
        <li>Going on a fun excursion trip</li>
        <li>Farewell day — A bittersweet moment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Friends and Teachers</h2>
    <p>My school friends were my second family. Our shared memories, laughter, and challenges made school life even more special.</p>
    <p>Teachers played a crucial role in guiding us. Their encouragement and wisdom shaped my outlook on education and life.</p>
    
    <h2>Sports and Extracurricular Activities</h2>
    <p>Sports days were always thrilling. Competing in races and various other matches made school even more exciting.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I participated in debates, competitions, and role play performances, building confidence along the way.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Though my school journey has ended, the memories and experiences will remain with me forever. School life was truly a golden period that I will always cherish. If there is still something that i could ask for, is to bring back my school life again. Hence, i just want those days back in my life again. </p>
