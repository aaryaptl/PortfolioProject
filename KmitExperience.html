        <h1>My Engineering Journey: 4 Years at KMIT</h1>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SEmpCPFQIno/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="KMIT Logo" width="450" height="250">
        <p>I am Aarya Patel (2022-2026) batch. I was in Information Technology(IT) bracnh. Before i forget, my permanent roll numnber was: 22BD1A1203. So, let's start with my journey and experience of 4 long years, here in KMIT.</p>
        <p>Engineering was not just about acquiring technical knowledge; it is a transformative journey filled with challenges, learning experiences, and personal growth. My four years at KMIT have been an incredible chapter of my life. As I look back on my journey, I can see the countless moments of struggle, excitement, discovery, and achievement that have made this experience unforgettable.</p>

            <h2>First Year: The Beginning of a New Chapter</h2>
            <img src="https://indoafrica.allegiance-educare.in/storage/uploads/colleges/1412673569kite4.jpg" alt="First Year Experience" width="700" height="300">
            <p>Entering KMIT as a freshman, I was filled with enthusiasm and curiosity. The transition from school to college life was both exciting and overwhelming. The first year was all about getting accustomed to the new environment, meeting new people, and understanding the expectations of an engineering student.</p>
            <p>The subjects were a mix of basic sciences and introductory engineering courses, which laid the foundation for what was to come. Mathematics, Physics, and Programming were some of the key subjects that intrigued me. The hands-on lab sessions were particularly interesting, as all the labs were equipped with Air Conditionings (ACs). Apart from that, we had direct access to the internet where we could spend time a lot and could make use of college WiFi as much as possible.</p>
            <p>One of the highlights of my first year was to be a part of various clubs in KMIT. KMIT offered a variety of clubs, and I wanted to eagerly join a few. But, unfortunately, we had lots of partialities over hiring new people into the club. As a result, I was not a part of any club, as the seniors only wanted their friends to be a part of any club.</p>

            <h2>Second Year: Diving Deeper into Engineering</h2>
            <img src="https://media.collegedekho.com/media/img/institute/crawled_images/1_QnPT8vb.png" alt="Second Year" width="700" height="300">
            <p>The second year was when the real engineering journey began. With core subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, Digital Electronics, and Database Management Systems, I started to grasp the essence of my field. I knew these were the subjects that were going to play a key role during my placements and further. Before this, I did not know how to even code a single line. People around me were super beyond me in coding and stuff. This is where the actual competition began. Now, even it was the time for me to bat on ground and develop interest in the field of coding and development.</p>
            <p>This was also the year I discovered my passion for software development. I worked on small coding projects and spent hours debugging code, which greatly enhanced my problem-solving skills. This was where I had to develop my interest, problem-solving skills, and analytical skills.</p>
            <p>Another significant aspect of my second year was group projects. Working in teams helped me understand the importance of collaboration, communication, and time management. I learned that engineering is not just about individual knowledge but also about teamwork and sharing ideas.</p>

            <h2>Third Year: Industry Exposure and Specialization</h2>

            <p>By the third year, I had a clear idea of my areas of interest. This was the year where theoretical knowledge met practical implementation. Subjects like Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Web Development fascinated me. I started working on more advanced projects and even built a few applications.</p>
            <p>Internships became a crucial part of my learning curve. I secured an internship in software development, where I got a chance to work on real-time projects and learn from industry professionals. This exposure helped me bridge the gap between academic learning and industry requirements.</p>
            <p>I also took part in technical paper presentations and workshops conducted by experts. These experiences honed my presentation skills and deepened my understanding of emerging technologies.</p>

            <h2>Final Year: Culmination of the Journey</h2>

            <p>The final year was a blend of excitement and pressure. On one hand, I was thrilled to be completing my engineering degree, and on the other, I was preparing for placements and my final year project.</p>
            <p>The "Smart Basketball Scoreboard" and "My Portfolio Website" project was one of the most significant milestones of my journey. It required everything I had learned over the yearsâ€”problem identification, research, development, and deployment. I worked closely with my mentors and team members to develop a meaningful project that could solve a real-world problem.</p>
